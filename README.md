## Overview

Build reliable, self-improving AI agents without hardcoding workflows. Define your goal through conversation with a coding agent, and the framework generates a node graph with dynamically created connection code. When things break, the framework captures failure data, evolves the agent through the coding agent, and redeploys. Built-in human-in-the-loop nodes, credential management, and real-time monitoring give you control without sacrificing adaptability.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v20.10+)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.0+)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adenhq/hive.git
cd hive

# Copy and configure
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml

# Run setup and start services
npm run setup
docker compose up
```

**Access the application:**

- Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:4000
- Health: http://localhost:4000/health

## Features

- **Goal-Driven Development** - Define objectives in natural language; the coding agent generates the agent graph and connection code to achieve them
- **Self-Adapting Agents** - Framework captures failures, updates objectives and updates the agent graph
- **Dynamic Node Connections** - No predefined edges; connection code is generated by any capable LLM based on your goals
- **SDK-Wrapped Nodes** - Every node gets shared memory, local RLM memory, monitoring, tools, and LLM access out of the box
- **Human-in-the-Loop** - Intervention nodes that pause execution for human input with configurable timeouts and escalation
- **Real-time Observability** - WebSocket streaming for live monitoring of agent execution, decisions, and node-to-node communication
- **Cost & Budget Control** - Set spending limits, throttles, and automatic model degradation policies
- **Production-Ready** - Self-hostable, built for scale and reliability
